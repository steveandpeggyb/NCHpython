Using an ODBC driver

Microsoft have written and distributed multiple ODBC drivers for SQL Server:
•{SQL Server} - released with SQL Server 2000
•{SQL Native Client} - released with SQL Server 2005 (also known as version 9.0)
•{SQL Server Native Client 10.0} - released with SQL Server 2008
•{SQL Server Native Client 11.0} - released with SQL Server 2012
•{ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server} - supports SQL Server 2005 through 2014
•{ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server} - supports SQL Server 2005 through 2016
•{ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server} - supports SQL Server 2008 through 2016
•{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server} - supports SQL Server 2008 through 2017

Note that the "SQL Server Native Client ..." and earlier drivers are deprecated and should not be used for new development.

The connection strings for all these drivers are essentially the same, for example:
DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=test;DATABASE=test;UID=user;PWD=password


or, in Python:

conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=test;DATABASE=test;UID=user;PWD=password')
